#### Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to create a smart alarm system in which the user can schedule alarms which will gather information about the current weather, news and COVID-19 information in their local area and then provide a text to speech alarm which will read out this information at a set time. The project also aims to provide a notification system which will notify the user when events occour during the day in text format. These notifications include notifying the user when the COVID-19 statistics are available for the current day in their current location and displaying the top news stories at set times of the day alongside a link to the full news articles.

#### Prerequisites:
An API key from openweathermap (openweathermap.org)
An API key from NewsAPI (newsapi.org)
A stable internet connection to allow for data to be gathered from the previously mentioned APIs
Python version 3.9 or above (developed using Python 3.9)

#### Installation:
install pip and then run the command: pip install pyttsx3 (or pip3 install pyttsx3) in the terminal

#### Instructions:
fill in the config file with information about your current country, current city and your two API keys. To run the program run the main.py file
